# Welcome to the messages file, here you'll be able to display your custom messages for the plugin.
# When you make a change in this file, you don't have to execute a command. Just save the file and the
# plugin will register your change.
#
#
#
# First, the plugin allow you to use the Minecraft color code. For example, if you want to put the message
# in red, you have to use "&4" before the text (all allowed color code are here : https://minecraft.tools/fr/color-code.php)
# But you can alose generate a gradient (=variation of one color A to another color B) in a chars string
# by using the code : "<s:[code RGB of the first color]>[your chars string]<e:[code RGB of the second color]>"
# Example :
# I want a gradient from light blue (code : 80FFFF) to pink (code : FF99FF) for the following sentence : "demonstration of a gradient"
# I'll have the following code :
#    <s:80FFFF>demonstration of a gradient<e:FF99FF>
# Note that you can use format code in you sentence (like italic or bold) to add before your sentence to color,
# so for our example before, if I want to have my gradient in bold, I'll have :
#    <s:80FFFF>&ldemonstration of a gradient<e:FF99FF>
#
#
#
# A message isn't just a text in the tchat ! You can do more.
# For each message, you can add :
# - a hover message : when the player puts his mouse cursor on the message in the tchat
# - a run command : when the player clicks on the message
# - a suggest command : when the player clicks on the message
# - an actionbar message : to display the message above his hotbar
#
# To configure them, it's very easy. You've to add a field with the same name as the message but with a word after :
# - Hover : for hover message
# - Run : to add a run command
# - Suggest : to add a suggest command
# - Hotbar : to add a message above the hotbar
# Exemple :
#   HelloMessage: "Hello player !"
#   HelloMessageHover: "Ho you put your mouse on me !"
#   HelloMessageRun: "/hello"
#   HelloHotbar: "Hello from the hotbar !"
#
# In our example, the message will send a message in the tchat to the player. When the player put his mouse cursor
# on the message, he will see "Ho you put your mouse on me !". When he will click on it, he will execute the command
# "/hello". And he will also see above his hotbar the message "Hello from the hotbar"
#
# You have to know that (if the message isn't necessary), you don't have to configure the original message to
# configure a Hotbar message. You'll see that I have configured some message like that.
#
#
#
# Some messages aren't necessaries. It's always wrote when you can skip the configuration of a message or not
#
#
#
# In the text who list the PlaceHolders usable, you'll sometimes see {block} or {property}. It's mean you can
# write more information in the message :
# {block_material} : write this to have the material of the block
# {block_loc_x} : write this to have to X pos of the block
# {block_loc_y} : write this to have to Y pos of the block
# {block_loc_z} : write this to have to Z pos of the block
# {block_loc_world} : write this to have the world name of the block pos
#
# {property_name} : write this to have the property name
# {property_durability} : write this to have the cost in durability of the property
# {property_perm} : write this to have the required perm to modify the property
#
#
#
# The plugin can use PlaceHolderAPI (or PAPI). You can, in each type of message put a placeholder from PAPI (don't
# forget to install the placeholders via "/papi ecloud download <placeholders>").
# In PlaceHolderAPI you can use three type of placeholders :
# - those who concern no player (eg: %server_name%) : usable everywhere in the plugin
# - those who concern an online player (eg:%player_name%) : your will be notified when you can use them
# - those who concern an offline player : for the moment, nowhere in the plugin
#
#
#
# To finish, you have to know that you can create your own variable in the field named "PersonalVariable".
# Her you'll be able to add your own variable with its value. And to use it in a message you have to put
# "{name_of_the_variable}". You can create as much as you want !
# Exemple :
# PersonalVariable:
#  prefix: "&3[&6&lProtected&e-DS&3]&r"
# To use the prefix variable, I have to put "{prefix}" in my message. And the plugin will replace "{prefix}" with
# "&3[&6&lProtected&e-DS&3]&r" (colored, of course).
#
#
#
# Good luck for the configuration of the message !


PersonalVariable:
  # In this case, I will be able to use this string in any message by writing '{prefix}'
  # <!> The case is important ! {pRefiX} ≠ {prefix}
  prefix: "#3399FF[<s:667db6>Debug<e:0082c8>#3399FF-<s:0082c8>Stick<e:667db6>#3399FF]&r"


# In the children fields of "OnUse", you can use all PlaceHolders from PAPI that concern a player.
# Here the Placeholders will concern the player who uses the debug stick.
OnUse:
  # When the player wants to edit a block but a plugin doesn't allow the
